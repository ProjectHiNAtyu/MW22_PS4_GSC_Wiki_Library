GSCBIN for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II 2022 PS4 (PlayStation 4) version


[ About ]


The GSCBIN Dump, GSC Injector, and GSC Dumper are based on the GSC Injection process devised by Mr. Sku-111 in Project Donetsk, which we have reconstructed and utilized.

I express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to Mr. Sku-111, who devised and implemented this injection process.

I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr. ATE, who has analyzed the GSC system compatible with the IW9+ engine, including the Asset Pool, and shared a wealth of information with us.

Thank you so much for always being at the forefront of CoD analysis.

Additionally, the GSC Source is based on Mr. xensik's gsc-tool and has been decompiled.

Thank you always, and I support you.
